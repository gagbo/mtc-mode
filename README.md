# Emacs major mode for mtc scripts

## Description

This is a mode to enable syntax highlighting, and maybe REPL support for the
mtc scripts used by `cimlib` simulation tool.

Note : This mode is under (light) development, and you should use it, not trust
it.

## Usage

Use `make install` and pray, or just copy the `mtc-mode.el` file in
a sensible place like `~/.emacs.d` and `require` it from your init
files
